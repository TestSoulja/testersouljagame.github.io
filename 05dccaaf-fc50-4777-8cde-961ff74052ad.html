The two characters have a different gameplay style, allowing quests to be approached in multiple ways.</p>

<p><i>Shadows</i> was released for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X/S">Xbox Series X/S</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">macOS</a> on March 20, 2025, with a version for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS">iPadOS</a> to be released at a later date.

<h2>Gameplay</h2>

<p><i>Assassin's Creed Shadows</i> is an action-adventure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stealth_game">stealth game</a> similar to its predecessors. It is developed on an upgraded version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft_Anvil">Anvil</a>, using dynamic lighting and environmental interactions. Improvements include the addition of breakable objects and the ability to manipulate shadows and use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grappling_hook">grappling hook</a> for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour">parkour</a>. The game's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_world">open world</a>, whose size is comparable to that of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed_Origins">Assassin's Creed Origins</a></i>, progresses through seasons, each affecting gameplay, including frozen water and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icicles">icicles</a> in winter, long grass and blooming plants in spring. Missions are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_gameplay">non-linear</a>, encouraging players to track and eliminate targets freely; in a change from previous games, vantage points exist to help the player look for points of interest, not to mark objectives. The player can also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribing">bribe</a> officials to ascertain the whereabouts of targets, or recruit and train a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy">spy</a> network to gather intelligence.</p>

<p>New gameplay features include the ability to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crawling_(human)">crawl</a> along the ground, helping the player avoid detection and pass through small openings. The character can venture into shallow water, breathing through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo">bamboo</a> stick. Eagle vision makes a comeback, but unlike <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed_Mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a></i>, it does not reveal NPCs through the walls; as enemies are denoted in red, while allies are highlighted in orange. Naoe and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke_(Assassin's_Creed)">Yasuke</a> can enter a new mode called "Observe", a fast and easy way of gathering information about targets. This mode is also available while crouching on high vantage points, enabling players to closely examine newly discovered places. Hiding in shadows makes a player character invisible to her enemies, both indoors and outdoors, so players may choose to destroy lit lanterns with Shurikens. Moving while crouching enables a player to move silently across creaking <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightingale_floor">nightingale floors</a>.</p>

<p>Players can switch between characters as they progress through missions. A diverse selection of historically accurate weapons is available, from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katana">katana</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanabō">kanabō</a> war club to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yari">yari</a> spears, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuriken">shuriken</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunai">kunai</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kusarigama">kusarigama</a>. Each weapon comes with its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skill_tree">skill tree</a>, enabling players to improve their proficiency. Yasuke's combat features <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destructible_environment">destructible environments</a> and realistic weapon impacts, providing a cinematic fighting experience, in addition to using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arquebus">arquebuses</a>, giving him a powerful long-range capability. Meanwhile, Naoe brandishes the iconic hidden blade with its pivot feature to serve as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantō">tantō</a>, as well as using a kusarigama to fend off attackers, swinging its chain in wide arcs to create distance. Moreover, she employs stealth tactics with an agile and lethal playstyle, hiding in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafter">rafters</a> and ambushing enemies through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoji">Shoji</a> paper doors.</p>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<h3>Setting</h3>

<p><i>Assassin's Creed Shadows</i> is set in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feudal_Japan">feudal Japan</a>, specifically starting in 1579 during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azuchi-Momoyama_period">Azuchi-Momoyama period</a>. This era marks the final stage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sengoku_period">Sengoku period</a>, a time of intense civil war in Japan. The game features the historical figure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a> at the height of his power following his victory over the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeda_clan">Takeda clan</a> using arquebus firearms. Key historical events include Nobunaga's assault on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_province">Iga province</a> in 1581, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenshō_Iga_War">significant battle</a> involving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iga_ikki">Iga ikki</a>, known for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninjutsu">ninjutsu</a> arts. Like previous <i>Assassin's Creed</i> titles, characters based on historical figures are present in the game, including samurai <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke">Yasuke</a>, the main character, missionaries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luís_Fróis">Luís Fróis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Valignano">Alessandro Valignano</a>, daimyō <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oda_Nobunaga">Oda Nobunaga</a>, samurai <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattori_Hanzo">Hattori Hanzo</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akechi_Mitsuhide">Akechi Mitsuhide</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ise_Sadaoki">Ise Sadaoki</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyōnyo?action=edit&amp;redlink=1">Kyōnyo</a> [<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/教如">jp</a>], merchants <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imai_Sōkun">Imai Sōkun</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imai_Sōkyū">Imai Sōkyū</a>, and tea master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sen_no_Rikyū">Sen no Rikyū</a>, amongst others.</p>

<p>The game explores central Japan, including regions like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto">Kyoto</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobe">Kobe</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osaka">Osaka</a>, and the Iga province, with historically-accurate castles such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeda_Castle">Takeda</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukuchiyama_Castle">Fukuchiyama</a>, along with detailed historical landmarks and strongholds designed as intricate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons">dungeons</a>. This setting reflects the urbanization of Japan at the time, bustling ports, samurai districts, and ornate architecture, all significant for parkour and exploration in the game. The influence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_maritime_exploration">Portuguese traders</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit_missionaries">Jesuit missionaries</a>, who introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity">Christianity</a> and new technologies like cannons and long guns, also plays a role in shaping the game's environment and narrative.</p>

<p>In 1581, the bodyguard Diogo arrives in Kyoto with a delegation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuit">Jesuit</a> priests to negotiate with Oda Nobunaga for the safe passage of all Jesuit priests through Japan. Nobunaga decides to grant the request, but only on the condition that Diogo be transferred under his service as a warrior, as he has taken an interest in him. Six months later, Diogo, now renamed Yasuke, accompanies Nobunaga on his assault against the Iga Province to exterminate the Iga ikki. During the battle, shinobi Fujibayashi Naoe is tasked by her father Nagato to take his Hidden Blade and use it recover a special box hidden in a nearby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kofun">kofun</a>, which she must protect at all costs. However, the box is stolen by group of masked samurai dubbed the "Shinbakufu", leaving Nagato mortally wounded. With his last breath, Nagato instructs Naoe to "follow the blade".</p>

<p>After recovering from her wounds, Naoe seeks her old family friend Tomiko for assistance. Tomiko agrees to allow Naoe use her farm as a base to gather supplies and allies, and directs her to head to the city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakai">Sakai</a> to follow the trail of the Shinbakufu. Upon arriving in Sakai, Naoe gathers additional allies and manages to track down and kill two of the Shinbakufu. She is then approached by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akechi_Mitsuhide">Akechi Mitsuhide</a>, who requests that she help him assassinate Nobunaga, who is the leader of the Shinbakufu. With Mitsuhide's help, Naoe infiltrates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honnō-ji">Honnoji Temple</a> and attacks Nobunaga, only to be stopped by Yasuke. Nobunaga claims that Mitsuhide lied to Naoe and that he has no ties to the Shinbakufu. Confused, Naoe leaves the temple while Nobunaga commits <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seppuku">seppuku</a> to prevent his head from falling into Mitsuhide's hands and leaving Yasuke a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronin">ronin</a>.</p>

<p>In order to take revenge on Mitsuhide, both Naoe and Yasuke converge on Katano Castle to find him. Yasuke then tells Naoe he wants to join her cause, recognizing the Hidden Blade she carries and hoping that he can find a new purpose following her. He reveals that when he killed the leader of Iga, Momochi Sandayu, he also carried a Hidden Blade and instructed Yasuke to help Naoe if he found her. Naoe considers killing Yasuke in revenge, but is convinced otherwise by one of her followers, Junjiro, whose father was one of the Shinbakufu she killed but he eventually chose to forgive her. Working together, Naoe and Yasuke continue their quest to track down and kill more of the Shinbakufu, eventually encountering and allying with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hattori_Hanzo">Hattori Hanzo</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokugawa_Ieyasu">Tokugawa Ieyasu</a>. Hanzo warns Naoe to forget about the box, as both Nagato and her mother Tsuyu died protecting it. However, seeing that Naoe will not back down, Hanzo instructs her to head to a kofun in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Settsu">Settsu</a> to find out the truth about her parents. There, she finds an Assassin hideout and journal, revealing the Assassin Order was instructed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Go-Nara">Emperor Go-Nara</a> to build a new Brotherhood in Japan, with Tsuyu being one of the Assassins given the task.</p>

<p>Eventually, Naoe and Yasuke manage to kill all of the Shinbakufu except for Mitsuhide himself. They head for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoryuji_Castle">Shoryuji Castle</a> where Mitsuhide is besieged by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashiba_Hideyoshi">Hashiba Hideyoshi</a> and join Hideyoshi's army, intending to reach Mitsuhide first to find the box's location. They defeat Mitsuhide, who reveals the true leader of the Shinbakufu is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashikaga_Yoshiaki">Ashikaga Yoshiaki</a>, who possesses the box. In addition, the box contains a special artifact called "The Jewel". Having learned what she needed, Naoe kills Mitsuhide to avenge her father. Hideyoshi claims victory and promises to reform Japan, with Naoe warning him to keep to that promise or face the wrath of the Assassins. Naoe and Yasuke then confront Yoshiaki, who surrenders and offers to trade both the Jewel and information for his life. He reveals that an Assassin was last spotted in Yamato, while a member of the Templar Order that Yasuke is searching for, Duarte de Melo, can be found in Port Obama. The pair spare Yoshiaki's life, but not before Yasuke points out that Nobunaga has made his mark in history while Yoshiaki will be forgotten.</p>

<p>Naoe travels to Yamato, where she finally recalls the story Nagato told her about Tsuyu. Many years ago, the Japanese Assassins led by Tsuyu were entrusted to protect the three Imperial Regalia. While the Brotherhood prospered for many years, they were suddenly attacked by Shinbakufu forces and massacred with two of the Imperial Regalia were stolen, leaving only Nagato, Tsuyu, and Sandayu as the remaining survivors. Tsuyu left to recover the stolen Imperial Regalia, but never returned. Naoe finds the Assassins' original hiding place for the Imperial Regalia and returns the Jewel, fulfilling her promise to her father. Hanzo then arrives to return the Mirror, which Ieyasu had taken back from the Templars. Hanzo admits that he betrayed the Assassins out of jealousy of Tsuyu choosing Nagato over him, revealing the location of the Imperial Regalia to the Shinbakufu. Naoe defeats Hanzo in battle and convinces him that the only way to earn redemption is to join the Assassins and help her search for Tsuyu.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Yasuke tracks down Duarte, who is revealed to be a slaver involved in Yasuke's past. Yasuke kills Duarte and begins searching for Nuno Caro, the leader of the Templar Order in Japan. He confronts Nuno and reveals that years ago, he and his mother were slaves aboard Nuno's ship. Nuno executed Yasuke's mother for being a suspected spy and was about to execute Yasuke as well when an Assassin intervened and sacrificed himself to buy Yasuke time to leap overboard and escape. Yasuke then attacks Nuno and kills him despite his warning that his death would be a declaration of war to the Templars.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p><i>Assassin's Creed Shadows</i> was announced at Ubisoft Forward in September 2022 under the working title <i>Assassin's Creed: Codename Red</i> along with its planned successor <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed#Assassin's_Creed:_Codename_Hexe">Assassin's Creed: Codename Hexe</a></i>. There, Ubisoft announced that <i>Assassin's Creed</i> would be entering a third period related to shifts in design philosophy and approaches to future games, all connected by a working concept called <i>Assassin's Creed Infinity</i> (later renamed to the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed#Animus_Hub">Animus Hub</a></i>). The first major gameplay details were announced on May 15, 2024, along with the final name and release date. It was also later revealed that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft_Quebec">Ubisoft Quebec</a> who previously developed <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed_Odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a></i> and <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed_Syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a></i> would be developing the game. Development began in 2020, following the release of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed_Valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a></i>.</p>

<p><i>Shadows</i> is the first game in the series to be aimed at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">ninth generation of video game consoles</a> (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S), dropping support for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_generation_of_video_game_consoles">eighth generation</a> consoles (PlayStation 4 and Xbox One). Lead producer Karl Onnée said the hardware available in the newer consoles was necessary to support the new version of their engine that supplies effects like light, shadows, and dynamic weather.</p>

<h2>Release and promotion</h2>

<p>Upon the release of the video game's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trailer_(promotion)">premiere trailer</a> on May 15, 2024, the decision to feature a fictional version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke">Yasuke</a> as a central character prompted criticism online. Conservative critics and fans on social media reacted negatively to the inclusion of a Black samurai protagonist instead of an indigenous Japanese one, accusing Ubisoft of "going <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woke">woke</a>", or stating that Yasuke was "not a 'real' samurai." Others noted that Ubisoft has never made a game with a male East Asian protagonist. The online backlash led to harassment and threats directed at the game developers, Laurence Russell of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wired_(magazine)">Wired</a></i> likened the backlash to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_(harassment_campaign)">Gamergate harassment campaign</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right">alt-right</a>. Ubisoft has defended their position on their choices for Yasuke in response to the criticism. Game director Charles Benoit said that Yasuke was chosen because players could discover Japan at the same time as Yasuke, "through his eyes, the eyes of a foreigner". Matt Kim of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN">IGN</a></i> praised the choice of Yasuke to differentiate itself from other samurai games featuring Asian protagonists. Scholar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Lockley">Thomas Lockley</a> defended Yasuke's portrayal as a samurai, and stated that no reputable Japanese historian had questioned Yasuke's samurai status.</p>

<p><i>Assassin's Creed Shadows</i> was initially scheduled to release for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPadOS">iPadOS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS">macOS</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows">Windows</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_Series_X/S">Xbox Series X/S</a> on November 15, 2024. In September 2024, Ubisoft announced that, despite the game being feature complete, they opted to delay the release to February 14, 2025, for further polishing, citing insights gained from the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a></i> launch in August. The company also cancelled the game's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Season_pass_(video_games)">season pass</a> and refunded existing pre-orders, with future pre-orders set to include the first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_pack">expansion</a> for free. In a shift from Ubisoft's previous release practices, the PC version would launch simultaneously on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_(service)">Steam</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_Games_Store">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubisoft_Connect">Ubisoft Connect</a>. In January 2025, Ubisoft postponed the release once again to March 20, as the company explored its sale options and to provide developers with more time to implement additional changes. After its new release date was unveiled, the game became subject to controversy due to the release date being the same day as the 30-year anniversary of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_subway_sarin_attack">Tokyo subway sarin attack</a>, a terrorist attack in Japan.</p>

<p><i>Shadows</i> was rated as "CERO Z" in January 2025 by Japan's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Entertainment_Rating_Organization">Computer Entertainment Rating Organization</a> (CERO), which legally limits sale of the game to adults; CERO issued its rating based on the amount of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphic_violence">gore</a> that was present in the game such as body dismemberment. While the game will be released internationally with an in-game toggle to show or disable the gore, Ubisoft said that they are working to make a Japan-specific version of the game which will not include the toggle and eliminate the gore from the game to achieve a less strict CERO rating. A collectible figure was scheduled to be released in promotion for the game.

<h2>Reception</h2>

<h3>Critical reception</h3>

<p><i>Assassin's Creed Shadows</i> received "generally favorable" reviews from critics, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Review_aggregator">review aggregator</a> website <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacritic">Metacritic</a>.</p>

<p>Giovanni Colantonio from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Trends">Digital Trends</a></i> praised the game for its "memorable characters and peaceful exploration" but criticised its "messy story and thin content". <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a></i>'s Tom Phillips wrote that it "honours the beauty of feudal Japan, even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists." <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GameSpot">GameSpot</a></i>'s Jordan Ramée said that it "messes with a good thing by including one too many playable protagonists, but Naoe is a valuable new addition to the legacy". <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a></i>'s Andrew Brown said that it "thrives on boldness. Its dual protagonists improve on the series' stealth-driven roots and modern RPG leanings, though they're let down by a vague story that fails to make full use of either character." Kevin Dunsmore of <i>Hardcore Gamer</i> thought it "had a lot of elements on paper that made it sound like it could be the best Assassin's Creed game in years." but said "it also falls short on nearly as many." <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGN">IGN</a></i>'s Jarrett Green wrote it "creates one of the best versions of the open-world style it's been honing for the last decade". Echo Apsey of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NME">NME</a></i> said "A fantastic story and well-developed characters ground the game in a believable era of Japan that is fun to explore. It confidently sets the standard for the next games in the franchise."</p>

<p>Morgan Park of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Gamer">PC Gamer</a></i> criticized the game's "dull story, bland cast, and barrage of quests", and Fraser Brown said that there was "a lot to like" but criticized the RPG elements. Reid McCarter of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCGamesN">PCGamesN</a></i> said "While its open world is stunning, its combat is robust, and its dual-protagonist design is somewhat novel, <i>Assassin's Creed Shadows</i> proves too repetitive and dramatically flat to wholeheartedly recommend taking its trip back in time." <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_Square">Push Square</a></i>'s Robert Ramsey praised the game for its "intriguing yet twisted story, great protagonists, solid combat and striking soundtrack" but criticised its "forced RPG elements and rough English dub". Aidan O'Brien from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shacknews">Shacknews</a></i> praised the game for its "interesting characters and fun combat" but criticised it for its "awkward traversal and weak voice acting from the NPCs". <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian">The Guardian</a></i>'s Daniella Lucas praised the game's "Excellent performances and emotionally resonant moments". <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_Game_Chronicle">Video Game Chronicle</a></i>'s Jordan Middler called it "the best <i>Assassin's Creed</i> game in 10 years". Dom Peppiatt from <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VG247">VG247</a></i> said "it's so fun to play, it's telling a gripping story, and there is so much sense of progress and reward for every little thing you do that it actually feels like an open world game".</p>
